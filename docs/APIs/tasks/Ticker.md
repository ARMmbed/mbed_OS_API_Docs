# Ticker

Use the Ticker interface to set up a recurring interrupt; it calls a function repeatedly and at a specified rate.

You can create any number of Ticker objects, allowing multiple outstanding interrupts at the same time. The function can be a static function, or a member function of a particular object.

## Hello World!

Try this program to set up a Ticker to repeatedly invert an LED:

### Warnings and notes

* Timers are based on 32-bit int microsecond counters, so they can only time up to a maximum of 2^31-1 microseconds (30 minutes). They are designed for times between microseconds and seconds. For longer times, you should consider the time() real time clock. 

* No blocking code in ISR: avoid any call to wait, infinite while loop or blocking calls in general. 

* No printf, malloc or new in ISR: avoid any call to bulky library functions. In particular, certain library functions (such as printf, malloc and new) are not re-entrant, and their behavior could be corrupted when called from an ISR. 

* RTOS Timer: Consider using the [mbed RTOS Timer](Timer.md) instead of a Ticker. In this way your periodic function will not be executed in an ISR, giving you more freedom and safety in your code. </span>
