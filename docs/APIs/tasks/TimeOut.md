# Timeout

Use the Timeout interface to set up an interrupt to call a function after a specified delay.

You can create any number of Timeout objects, allowing multiple outstanding interrupts at the same time.

## Hello World!

Set up a Timeout to invert an LED after a given timeout:

## Warnings and notes

* Timers are based on 32-bit int microsecond counters, so they can only time up to a maximum of 2^31-1 microseconds (30 minutes). They are designed for times between microseconds and seconds. For longer times, you should consider the time() real time clock. 

* No blocking code in ISR: avoid any call to wait, infinite while loop or blocking calls in general. 

* No printf, malloc or new in ISR: avoid any call to bulky library functions. In particular, certain library functions (such as printf, malloc and new) are not re-entrant, and their behavior could be corrupted when called from an ISR. 

* RTOS Timer: consider using the [mbed RTOS Timer](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/RTOS) instead of a Timeout. Your callback function will not be executed in an ISR, giving you more freedom and safety in your code.
