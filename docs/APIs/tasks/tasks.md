# Managing tasks

The task management APIs handle creation and destruction of threads in mbed OS 5, as well as mechanisms for safe inter-thread communication. Threads are a core component of mbed OS 5 (even your `main` function starts in a thread of its own), so understanding how to work with them is a very important part of developing application for mbed OS 5. Pay particular attention to the [interrupt service routines](rtos.md#interrupt-service-routines) section, which contains important information about how the task management APIs can be used from an interrupt handler.
