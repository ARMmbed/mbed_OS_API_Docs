## Security APIs

Security on mbed OS is divided into two parts:

* [Device security through mbed uVisor](uvisor.md).
* [Connection security through mbed TLS](tls.md).

The sections cover working with these modules in the context of mbed OS. For generic documentation for both modules, see:

* [mbed uVisor full documentation](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/uvisor-and-uvisor-lib-documentation/en/latest/).
* [mbed TLS full documentation](https://tls.mbed.org/).
