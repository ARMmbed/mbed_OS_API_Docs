You can independently create, start and stop any number of Timer objects.

<span class="warnings">**Warning:** Timers are based on 32-bit int microsecond counters, so they can only time up to a maximum of 2^31-1 microseconds (30 minutes). They are designed for times between microseconds and seconds. For longer times, you should consider the `time()` real time clock. </span>
